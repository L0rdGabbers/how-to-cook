* One user story, instructions, was reinterpreted to include the instructions on the recipe's main page as opposed to being on their own separate view.

### **Site Aims**

The Time to Dine site had two main goals:

- 1: To provide an online hub wherein people can find a cooking recipe
- 2: To provide a place for people to share their own recipes on the internet in a stylish and sleek format.
